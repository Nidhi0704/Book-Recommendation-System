### **Get personalized book suggestions from the top 50 popular books!**

---

## 🌟 **Overview**

Welcome to the **Book Recommendation System**! This project uses **machine learning**, **EDA**, and **collaborative filtering** to recommend 7 similar books based on any input book you provide. By analyzing the features of the top 50 popular books, we aim to enhance user experience by offering highly relevant book suggestions.

## 🎯 **Features**

- **Top 50 Popular Books**: The system starts by showing the top 50 most popular books.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: For any book you input, the system will suggest 7 similar books based on various features like genre, author, and ratings.
- **User-Friendly**: Built using Flask, this web app provides a seamless user experience.
- **Advanced ML Techniques**: Leverages machine learning, collaborative filtering, and cosine similarity to make accurate recommendations.

---

## 🧠 **Tech Stack**

- **Machine Learning**: Implements Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering for personalized suggestions.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Cleaned and processed data to ensure high-quality recommendations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights from the data for better understanding and prediction accuracy.
- **Flask**: Lightweight framework to serve the model and recommendations in a web interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: For front-end development and enhancing user interface.

## 🚀 **How It Works**

1. **Data Collection**: We work with a dataset of top 50 popular books, including features like title, author, genre, and ratings.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed for better performance.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing book trends to understand user preferences.
4. **Collaborative Filtering & Content-Based Filtering**: To suggest similar books based on the one you input.
5. **Flask App**: The recommendations are displayed on a simple and intuitive webpage powered by Flask.
